2,"What happened to Elliana Walmsley Fans Want Healing  Elliana Walmsley, who has a lot of followers on YouTube, posted a picture to Instagram, and it quickly went viral. She was set up on the hospital bed so that she was sitting on it. She was putting on a hospital gown and carrying a bunch of flowers. The appearance of this picture caused her followers to feel worried and tense. Most of Walmsley’s readers started leaving comments right away. They wished her a quick recovery and asked what had happened. At least a few of them really cared about what had happened. The content creator was sitting on a hospital bed in the photos that the Instagram user @thepapparazzigamer posted. At first, everyone thought Elliana was taken to the hospital because she had been in an accident. In the end, several Instagram users said that the photos were taken during a shoot for a video that the content producer planned to put on YouTube. The person makes prank videos with a lot of followers. Her joke movies have a way of making people think what they see is real. Elliana Walmsley recently posted a video of herself online that looked like she had broken her leg. However, she said the video was fake. Because of this, people now think that the pictures are just from the set of her latest YouTube prank movie.   Who is this Elliana Walmsley person, anyway? Yolanda and Kevin Walmsley’s daughter Elliana was born in Colorado on June 23, 2007. Luke and Jacob are her brothers, while she has no sisters. She is a dancer, a content producer, and a reality TV star, but Dance Moms, the sixth season, is where she is best known. She posts videos on YouTube. In season 6 of Dance Moms, the performer was on the ALDC Mini Squad. In season 7, she was moved up to the elite team. She was one of the most skilled dancers in the show. The artist got the Mini Solo Award for her work on the Sing for You album. The TV Star went on to win more championships and eventually joined the Elite Dance Academy after her success in the competitions. In addition to being a student on the honour roll, she is also a cheerleader with the Cheer Central Suns cheerleading organisation. The performer is passionate about the world of musical theatre and has her sights set on soon being a main ballerina at the American Ballet Theatre. After eventually joining Piper Rockelle’s YouTube organisation known as “The Squad” in the year 2020, the young person went on to launch a successful career as a YouTube content creator. Additionally, she became a member of the Vibe Crew group on TikTok in that same year. The celebrity, Elliana Walmsley, has also launched her own YouTube channel, which now has more than one million followers. Additionally, she has amassed more than two million followers on Instagram, and her job as an influencer is going from strength to strength.

7,"What’s New In GitLab 13.9 Release  In this interview, Brian Glanz, Sr. DevOps Evangelist at GitLab, talks about the 13.9 release of GitLab.  ",https://tfir.io/whats-new-in-gitlab-13-9-release/
8,"GitLab Releases Updates to CI/CD Platform GitLab this week made available a 13.9 update that adds more than 60 new features and updated capabilities to its namesake open source continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform.Brian Glanz, a product marketing manager for GitLab, said chief among those capabilities is a Security Alert Dashboard that enables DevOps teams to triage high-priority alerts more easily. As more organizations embrace DevSecOps best processes, application development teams need to be able to prioritize which security issues are more pressing than others, Glanz said.  Sponsorships Available   Other new capabilities include the ability to reuse a pipeline of a CI/CD configuration, and a maintenance mode option that keeps instance available while administrative tasks are being performed.Additionally, it’s now possible to view group-level analysis of release metrics, in addition to the ability to view a version of a pipeline configuration with all of the include and extends configurations merged together.Glanz said GitLab continues to gain traction, because all the capabilities it provides are based on the same integrated code base. The effort a DevOps team needs to exert to take advantage of new capabilities is substantially less than rival platforms, Glanz said.At the same time, Glanz noted that the number of contributors to GitLab coming from outside the company also continues to increase. The latest version has 299 merged contributions from the wider GitLab community.It’s not clear how much of an appetite organizations have, these days, to replace an existing CI/CD platform. However, it’s not uncommon for organizations to have multiple CI/CD platforms employed by different DevOps teams. In the meantime, the number of teams within enterprise IT organizations that are embracing DevSecOps processes to advance digital business transformation initiatives continues to rise. As more organizations realize how dependent they are on custom software to differentiate themselves from rivals, more enterprise IT organizations will opt to standardize on a single CI/CD platform to both reduce costs and increase overall efficiency.A report published last year by GitLab noted organizations can improve application development and delivery by 87%, resulting in a savings of more than $23 million. Overall, the report claims organizations can see a 407% return on investment (ROI) on the GitLab platform.Naturally, competition among CI/CD platform providers remains fierce. With most developers working from home to help combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, these platform providers have been touting their ability to support remote work. It’s not clear if developers will be returning to the office en masse now that COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed. However, it’s clear that even once the pandemic subsides, the way application code is created and maintained will be a lot more fluid. Many organizations are now more comfortable hiring developers wherever they can find them.Of course, many of those developers are going to be wary of joining organizations that have disjointed workflows, especially when it comes to shifting responsibility for application security further left toward developers. In fact, the ability of any organization to effectively recruit developers is now directly tied to the overall sophistication of their DevOps workflows.

9,"None   SKILup Day: DevSecOps Event Recap On August 12, 2021, the one-day virtual conference explored DevSecOps as a discipline. SKILup Day featured “how-to” lessons from speakers Alan Shimel, Kevin E. Greene, Ravi Lachhman, Taylor Smith, Bryan Finster, Colin Bell, Tracy Bannon, Peter Maddison, Scott Gerlach, Stephen Walters, Andy Suderman, Sven Ruppert, Jon Jarboe, Cindy Blake, Dr. Mark Peters, Tyler Johnson, Rob Cuddy, and Cristian Iordache. If you missed the DevSecOps SKILup Day, we’ve got you covered with a quick round-up of the top themes that emerged from the sessions and conversations around the importance of the topic. Why Devote a Full Day of Learning to DevSecOps? DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. The traditional centralized security team model must adopt a federated model allowing each delivery team to factor the proper security controls into their DevOps practices. In this article published in DevOps Digest, DevOps Institute CEO Jayne Groll said, “Baking security into your software and apps from the beginning is more important than ever. Without security, your development lifecycle is open to bugs and vulnerabilities, putting your organization and customers at risk. DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps, allowing for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. This approach shifts security to the left, ensuring that security is implemented at the beginning of the development lifecycle.” Read more: 12 DevSecOps Trends to Watch Right Now While DevSecOps practices are still evolving, there are many trends to keep an eye on. SKILup Day speakers covered several trending themes, including introducing various aspects of DevSecOps, an in-depth look at integrating security into DevOps, improving pipeline security, and real-life use cases and experiences. Below we look at key quotes and discussion points from the day. Kickstarting DevSecOps A key theme among speakers at SKILup Day was introducing the audience to various aspects of DevSecOps, including how to get started. Many speakers had specific insights into common pitfalls and provided insight on how to avoid them. DevOps Institute Ambassador, Stephen Walters of xMatters Inc., went back to the “basics” during his session, “DevSecOps Principles.” The session featured foundational insights from Walters on what DevSecOps is and is not and what is so different or special from DevOps. He did a deep dive into why DevSecOps is so important, the practicalities of implementing a strong solution and use cases. He also stressed that “our customers need to have trust in our ability to hold that very precious data.” Andy Suderman of Fairwinds shared valuable insights during his session, “Do’s and Don’ts of Kubernetes Security.” Suderman stressed that DevSecOps is not a trend, and it is not going away. He then gave insight into the tools you should use and also how to ensure that Dev, Sec and Ops teams are working together for the good of the organization. Here are just a few Do’s and Don’ts that Suderman presented:  Don’t: expect security by default using native controls Do: use pod security context options Don’t: grant access to the host node Do: set up a network policy Don’t: run containers with known vulnerabilities  Tyler Johnson of CloudBees presented the session, “IT Modernization Through DevSecOps.” He discussed the importance of automated processes, metric collection, compliance, and continuous feedback across teams. He then explored how DevSecOps practices allow IT Modernization efforts to manage better and monitor the path to production and meet the evolving complexities of modern software delivery. Johnson said, “It’s important to remain flexible to keep your technical debt to a minimum” when discussing choosing tools and defining your best practices. 8 DevSecOps pitfalls to avoid   Hey Dev! Wait a Sec… How to better enable development teams was another area of focus that emerged during SKILup Day. During his session, “Three Reasons Developers Struggle with AppSec…and How to Make it Better,”  Scott Gerlach of StackHawk presented real-life learning experiences when sharing his triumphs and failures while building DevSecOps practices and tools at companies such as GoDaddy, SendGrid, and Twilio. He shared that three reasons developers struggle with AppSec are:  The benevolent security team or lack thereof AppSec tools are built for security teams The production bias  He presented that you can “make it better” through test-driven security and instrumenting security tests into CI/CD to give engineers immediate feedback. He then emphasized to “allow technology to spark collaboration between Development and Security but enable Devs to do their work.”  Cindy Blake of GitLab shared key insights during her session, “How to Successfully Integrate Security Into Your DevOps.” Blake explored how to mitigate risk while maintaining development velocity by focusing on the software assembly line – the CI pipeline.  She began the session with key trends that affect security programs, including shift left, the need to scale the security program and policy-driven automation. She then shared how to enable developers to address security findings in a developer-friendly way with drill-down capabilities. Blake then explained that the key to balancing application security and development velocity is testing earlier in the software lifecycle is key, along with end-to-end visibility and control.   Taylor Smith of Bridgecrew shared practical advice and tactical tips to start implementing IaC security scanning and fixing security issues right away during his session “Putting the “Sec” in DevSecOps: Automating Cloud Security as an Enabler.” He shared how (with little effort) you can adopt DevSecOps with the right training, tools, processes and strategy.  He stressed that “even with a security resource at hand, the chance of catching each bad Terraform default or hidden in a wide-open IAM policy is near impossible across endless cloud services.” He concluded the presentation with how to implement a cloud DevSecOps strategy and how to roll out your IaC governance program.  Finally, Tracy Bannon, Kevin Greene and Bryan Finster joined forces for a panel discussion: “Who’s Looking Out For the Developers??” One of the topics that they discussed was what it means to have joint ownership of security. The panelists expressed that security cannot be a stage gate. Just as quality cannot be effectively inspected at the end, security must be applied with everything we do while still enabling small, frequent changes. Tracy Bannon said, “As we push more responsibility left, we need to keep focused on security design, secure coding, upskilling/training and mentoring all those who make up a delivery organization.” Accelerate your upskilling journey – Get certified in DevSecOps  Tightening the Valves — Pipeline Security Many speakers had specific insights into securing the pipeline. DevOps Institute Ambassador Peter Maddison of Xodiac gave first-hand advice during his session, “Securing Your Pipes with a TACO.” Maddison explained that the primary purpose of TACO is to provide a common language for the organization to understand what “good” pipelines mean for them and how to get there. The session included insight into how taking a TACO approach can be considered a part of implementing a DevSecOps program.  Ravi Lachhman of Harness returned for another SKILup Day. This month, he presented the session, “Pipeline Security a Catalyst for DevSecOps.” Lachhman explored how your CI/CD Pipeline can be a conduit of several security-centric steps. When discussing building security into your CI/CD pipelines, he said, “as engineers, we are under the gun to deliver with our agile sprints, making informed decisions are key.” He then shared the basics of application security terminology and several automatable methods for coverage.  Jon Jarboe of Accurics also took on pipeline security during the DevSecOps SKILup Day. He shared valuable insights during his session, “DevSecOps: Moving Beyond SAST in Pipelines.” Jarboe emphasized that it’s tempting to believe that adding SAST scanning to your pipelines is an easy step toward DevSecOps, but the reality is that doing so can be counterproductive.  Jarboe indicated how DevSecOps teams could carefully select and configure tooling to avoid creating friction in the development process. He then shared how to leverage SAST and static analysis in automated DevSecOps processes while avoiding common pitfalls. In addition to advocating for a developer-first approach to security, he presented the following as potential solutions to DevSecOps challenges:  Automated fixes Improved accuracy Risk scoring  12 Ways to Bake Security Into a DevOps Transformation    Experimenting with Security Many speakers shared insights into going beyond DevSecOps. During his session, “The Major Impact of Runtime Security Controls on Risks and Efficiency,” Christian Iordache of Bitdefender explored how different runtime controls impact security effectiveness. Iordache indicated that “runtime controls remain an essential piece of the security puzzle: they prevent 0-day exploits and ensure visibility into runtime anomalies, potential attacks, and the containers and pods impacted.” He then proposed how cloud workload protection platforms can automate and streamline your security workflows. DevOps Institute Ambassador Dr. Mark Peters of Novetta presented the session, “Measuring the Whole Hole.” During his session, he discussed integrating requirements and automating non-vulnerability standards. He also explored using unified mark-up language integrated requirements and how common tools can link users, integrate contingency plans, and expedite compliance to increase value. He did a deep dive into identifying and measuring various holes, including compliance holes, vulnerability holes and personal holes.  Rob Cuddy and Colin Bell of HCL Software teamed up for the session “Go Beyond DevSecOps to Continuous Security.” They emphasized that “the current thinking around DevSecOps traditionally focuses on adding security practices to pipelines. This is a great thing, but it is not enough.” They gave tangible advice on the phases of implementing Continuous Security.  Finally, Sven Ruppert of JFrog stressed that attacks like the “Solarwinds Hack” are becoming more and more sophisticated and that the attackers now focus on the entire value chain. His session, “The SolarWinds Hack and the Executive Order on Cybersecurity Happened – It is Time to Prepare,” explored how you can prepare for the challenges of cyberattacks.    What’s Next?
